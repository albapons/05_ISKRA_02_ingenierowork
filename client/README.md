### React Scaffolding Step by Step

- Create React app with npx create-react-app my-app . (Change my-app to the name of your app, e.g. npx create-react-app emefa-mvp .
- In VSCode, in src folder, delete the App.test.js , serviceWorker.js ,setupTests.js and logo.svg files.
- In index.js , remove serviceWorker setup (lines 14-17), and the import from line 5.
- In App.css remove the default styling, but keep the file for if you will use some css styling later.
- In App.js , remove the logo import in line 2, and the header content in lines 8 - 21 (between the <header> tag).
- Change the functional component into class component, so you can add some state later on.
